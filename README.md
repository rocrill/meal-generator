### Structure:

The site has 2 pages: 

Home page - The 'Home' page contains an eye-catching plate image, which is divided into 3 sections - 50% of vegetable content, 25% of protein content and 25% of carbohydrate content. 
There user is first invited to select their dietary preference by clicking on the desired radio button. 
There is then a clear 'Inspire me!' call to action button which generates a new meal idea everytime the user clicks it, sticking to the recommended food group percentages.

Underneath this is a brief explanation of the balanced meal generator and its purpose. 

Nutrition quiz -  The 'Nutrition quiz' page gives the user a chance to put their nutritional knowledge to the test, providing some light entertainment which relates to the main feature of the site - the generator.

For consistency of user experience, the site logo, navigation links and footer remain consitent throughout the site.

  Some slightly different shades of similar colors were also used in different parts of the site to achieve the best possible contrast for user experience.
