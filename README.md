### Structure:

The site has 2 pages: 

Home page - The 'Home' page contains an eye-catching plate image, which is divided into 3 sections - 50% of vegetable content, 25% of protein content and 25% of carbohydrate content. 
There user is first invited to select their dietary preference by clicking on the desired radio button. 
There is then a clear 'Inspire me!' call to action button which generates a new meal idea everytime the user clicks it, sticking to the recommended food group percentages.

Underneath this is a brief explanation of the balanced meal generator and its purpose. 

Nutrition quiz -  The 'Nutrition quiz' page gives the user a chance to put their nutritional knowledge to the test, providing some light entertainment which relates to the main feature of the site - the generator.

For consistency of user experience, the site logo, navigation links and footer remain consitent throughout the site.
